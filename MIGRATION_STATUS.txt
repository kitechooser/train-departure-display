MIGRATION STATUS - Phase 4 (Service Integration)
==============================================

Current Phase: 4 (Service Integration & Testing)
Status: In Progress
Last Updated: 27/01/2025 09:44

TODAY'S PROGRESS (27/01/2025)
--------------------------
- Fixed event handling in MainService to properly handle migration config
- Updated Rail API client authentication to use SOAP header token
- Fixed event emission format in update loops
- Added proper error logging for API responses

COMPLETED STEPS
--------------
1. Phase 1: API and Domain Layer
   - Created API layer structure
   - Implemented base API client
   - Implemented TfL API client
   - Added error handling and retry logic
   - Fixed Rail API client XML namespace handling
   - Updated Rail API tests with proper SOAP response format
   - Achieved 89% test coverage for Rail API client
   - Added comprehensive logging for API responses

2. Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer
   - Implemented event bus
   - Added configuration management
   - Created queue management system
   - Added comprehensive logging

3. Phase 3: Presentation Layer
   - Implemented new rendering system
   - Created component hierarchy
   - Added display management
   - Implemented text alignment system

CURRENT ISSUES
-------------
1. Grid Layout Padding Test Failure
   - Issue: test_grid_padding in tests/presentation/renderers/layouts/test_grid.py is failing
   - Current Status: White pixels in padding area not being preserved correctly
   - Latest Fix Attempt: Implemented pixel-by-pixel copying mechanism
   - Impact: Blocking final phase completion

2. Service Integration
   - Status: In Progress
   - Completed:
     * Rail API client XML parsing improvements
     * Test coverage for Rail API client
     * XML namespace handling in SOAP requests
     * Event system integration
   - Missing Connections:
     * Rail API authentication (in progress)
     * Announcement service needs to be connected to main service
     * Status service integration with display updates
     * Event handling between services needs verification
   - Impact: Critical for system functionality

NEXT STEPS (For Next Session)
------------------------
1. Service Integration (Priority)
   - Test Rail API with new authentication method
   - Complete announcement service integration
   - Connect status service to display updates
   - Verify event propagation between services
   - Add integration tests for service interactions

2. Fix Grid Layout Issue
   - Debug pixel copying mechanism
   - Add logging for pixel operations
   - Consider alternative padding implementation
   - Add visual regression tests

3. Testing & Verification
   - Run full test suite after each integration
   - Add service integration tests
   - Test error handling between services
   - Verify event propagation

4. Final Steps
   - Remove legacy code
   - Update documentation
   - Performance testing
   - Final integration testing

DEPENDENCIES
-----------
- Python 3.9+
- PIL/Pillow for image manipulation
- pytest for testing framework
- Event bus for service communication
- ElementTree for XML parsing
- Requests for HTTP communication

BLOCKING ISSUES
-------------
1. Grid layout padding test failure
2. Incomplete service integration
3. Missing integration tests
4. Rail API authentication issues

RISKS
-----
1. Service integration complexity may reveal new issues
2. Grid layout fix might affect other components
3. Legacy code removal could impact functionality
4. Event handling edge cases may be uncovered
5. XML parsing edge cases in Rail API client
6. API authentication failures

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------
1. Verify Rail API authentication method
2. Add comprehensive integration tests
3. Fix grid layout padding issue
4. Document service interactions
5. Consider adding service monitoring
6. Add XML response validation for Rail API
7. Consider implementing XML schema validation
8. Add performance monitoring for API calls
9. Implement better error handling for API authentication failures
